# Weather Application

Hello there, this is a project that I've been inspired to do as there are a lack of backend heavy projects on my Github that allows me to showcase my skills.

I've done two things here which are creating an API and also a frontend project to interact with the API. Below shows the command to run it together at the same time with literal just a line on the command line.

This project was also inspired due to the constant need to check UV index to contemplate if I should put on sunscreen or not :sweat_smile:

Tech Stack: MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node)

## How to install the dependencies

Firstly, install the dependencies in both /weather-app and the root of the folder by typing:

`npm install`

## How to run the application

Simply run:

`npm run dev`

## Things you need to get this work

- Your own .env file that contains the following:
  - Mongodb Account
  - Port Numnber (Other than 5000 as that is the port used for front end)
  - Database Username
  - Database Password
  - Database Name
  - Name of the database collection
  - Cluster URL
  - Client URL

## Things to work upon further

- Improve the front end design (it is not exactly aesthetically pleasing at the moment (not to my standard at least)
- Add more test cases to cover a wider range of scenarios such as more edge cases and more corner cases
